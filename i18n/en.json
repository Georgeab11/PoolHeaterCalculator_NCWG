Select the 'Activity Factor' from the drop-down list of pool types \n\n 3. [Time to warm-up pool for the first time] can be left empty in this case the app will suggest one, however it is recommended at 48h \n\n 4. Enter the COP of your heat pump indicated on the specs sheet of your device, by default it is 5 (Higher for Inverter types) \n\n 5. SAVE/SHARE results \n\n 6- Swipe left on the project to delete it. \n\n Enjoy your app!",
